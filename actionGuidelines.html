    <h3>COURSE OF ACTION GUIDELINE CHART</h3>
    <P>
        The chart does not cover all possible misconduct but does try to give guidelines to the type of 
        misconduct and possible course of action to be taken. The list of recommended sanctions is 
        intended to serve as guidelines in the interest of consistency and fairness. Deviation from the norms 
        established by the guidelines may be justified in proper circumstances. Special circumstances 
        surrounding any particularly case may therefore justify the imposition of a lesser or more serious 
        sanction.
